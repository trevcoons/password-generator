# password-generator

This site randomly generates a password based on user preferences. The site takes in user input to display a randomly generated password.



## Functionality

When the generate password button is pressed, the user is prompted to enter how long they would like their password to be ranging from 8 to 128 characters. Then they are prompted to select what type of characters they would like to use in the password. These include letters both upper and lowercase, numbers and/or special characters. After the user makes their selection, a password is randomly generated based on their preferences.
